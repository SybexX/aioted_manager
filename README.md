[![Validate with hassfest](https://github.com/nliaudat/aioted_manager/actions/workflows/hassfest.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nliaudat/aioted_manager/actions/workflows/hassfest.yaml)

This custom integration allows you to seamlessly integrate and manage your [AI on the Edge Device](https://jomjol.github.io/AI-on-the-edge-device-docs/) (AIOTED) water, gas, or electricity meter readers directly with Home Assistant. It eliminates the need for an MQTT gateway, offering a more streamlined and direct integration. It provides sensor data, image capture, and reboot functionality, along with advanced features like image upload and CSV logging.

## Displaying the Latest Image in Lovelace

You can use the [Local File integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/local_file/) to display the latest image in your Lovelace dashboards:

1.  **Configure `local_file` Integration:**
    *   Add the `local_file` integration to your Home Assistant instance if you haven't already.
2.  **Add a Local File Camera:**
    *   In your `configuration.yaml` add a camera with path to the latest image:

      ```yaml
      camera:
        - platform: local_file
          file_path: www/aioted_manager/<instance_name>/latest.jpg
          name: "AIOTED <instance_name>"
      ```
    * Replace <instance_name> by you instance name (cold, water_meter...)
3.  **Add Camera to Dashboard:**
    *   Now you can add the camera to your dashboard as a card

## Usage

1.  **View Sensor Data:** The sensor entity will update automatically based on the configured scan interval. You can add it to your dashboards or use it in automations.
2.  **Use the Reboot Button:** Click the button to reboot the AIOTED device.
3.  **Trigger Services:**
    *   Go to **Developer Tools > Services**.
    *   Select the `aioted_manager.collect_data` or `aioted_manager.upload_data` service.
    *   Enter the `instance_name` in the data section.
    *   Click "Call Service."
4.  **Advanced Usage:**
    *   You can use the image in your dashboard.
    *   The integration saves all values in the `log.csv` file in the `www/aioted_manager/<instance_name>/` folder.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Cannot connect to AIOTED device:**
    *   Double-check the IP address.
    *   Ensure that the AIOTED device is powered on and connected to the network.
    *   Verify that the AIOTED device is running the correct software version.
*   **No data in Home Assistant:**
    *   Check the Home Assistant logs for errors related to `aioted_manager`.
    *   Ensure that the scan interval is not too high.
    *   Check the AIOTED device's log.
*   **Image upload fails:**
    *   Check the URL.
    *   Check the API key.
    *   Check the upload server log.
